  ## Description
  This application is a simple note taking app that allows the user to store notes on the server, call them up, delete them, and add new ones. 
  <br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, JSON, NPM, Express, Git Bash, GitHub, UUID, and Heroku.
  <br>

  There are a lot of challenges with this application. Mainly the linking of all the files and getting the paths correct. It was difficult getting used to working with a local server and learning the hard way about forgetting to npm start after changes. 
  <br>
  
  In the future, I would like to update the CSS to make it more my own.
