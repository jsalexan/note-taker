  ## Description
  This application is a simple note taking app that allows the user to store notes on the server, call them up, delete them, and add new ones.
  <br><br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, JSON, NPM, Express, Git Bash, GitHub, UUID, and Heroku.
  <br><br>

  There are a lot of challenges with this application. Mainly the linking of all the files and getting the paths correct. 
  <br><br>
  
  In the future, I would like to make this work. And update the CSS.
